NOTE: The arduino connection is unecessary, but included because it was initially part of the project, and due to time constraints was unable to be eliminated
The ideal PetTrack program would only have the Raspberry Pi which would handle the motion sensor itself, and no Arduino. 
The project changed relatively significantly close to the deadline, which is again why the Arduino is still integrated. 

PetTrackArduino is to run on the Arduino.
PetTrackRaspberry is to run on the Raspberry Pi.
PetTrackInterface can run on any python capable device, it can be the Raspberry Pi or a seperate computer. 

Keep in mind the defined variables. You may have to change the pins and serial port number depending on your connections.
